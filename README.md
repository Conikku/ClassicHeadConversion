# ClassicHeadConversion

<img align="right" src="/icon.webp" alt="cool icon">

* ClassicHeadConversion tries to convert roblox dynamic heads to their classic face and head counterparts.
* Head to the example [script](/example.server.luau) for an example on how to use it!
> <sub>This was originally made for my game [Super Sonic Robloxia Adventure](https://www.roblox.com/games/10417853509/Super-Sonic-Robloxia-Adventure/) as it is a Classic Roblox styled Sonic fan game and it uses Roblox's classic face system to change the face of a player via a decal in the player's head</sub>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is pretty much now obsolete because of Dogutsune's [Facial Unification](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/85110005799468/Facial-Unification) module, which doesnt require HttpsService and does a much better job then my system. Only downside is that it only works in R15, unlike my system.
>Keep in mind my version doesnt change the head shape, it did in the legacy version, i'll maybe make a modified version of the legacy one with httpsservice support.
> You need to enable Allow HTTP Requests in File > Experience Settings > Security

> [!WARNING]
> The model on the roblox asset store is legacy and won't be updated, you can only grab it from here.<br>
> You can either clone this repository, or grab an .rbxm file from the latest [release](https://github.com/Conikku/ClassicHeadConversion/releases/latest) instead

> [!NOTE]
> There is a legacy version of this repository listed within the [legacy](/legacy) directory, however it is not advised to use this version as it is no longer supported/maintained. <sub><sup>It also uses `require` with a number... which is not good design.</sup></sub>
