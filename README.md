# ClassicHeadConversion

# THIS README IS A WIP
## The model on Roblox is legacy and won't be updated, you can only grab it from here. You need basic scripting knowledge to understand how to set this up, you can use the example.luau script provided in this github as a example how to use it.

### Converts Roblox Dynamic heads to a classic form

###### ClassicHeadConversion converts Dynamic heads to their classic face and head counterparts.
###### This was originally made for my game [Super Sonic Robloxia Adventure](https://www.roblox.com/games/10417853509/Super-Sonic-Robloxia-Adventure/) as it is a Classic Roblox styled Sonic fan game and it uses Roblox's classic face system to change the face of a player via a decal in the player's head
